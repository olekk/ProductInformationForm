# ProductInformationForm

Create a component that is a product information form (use react-hook-form)
with fields:
Product title, product description, product bullets, keywords.

* Product title should be the only required field (use zod).

* Product description should be an editable box with bold, italics, underline
formatting (use quill).

* Product bullets should be a list that can be modified (add / edit / remove
/ change order - use dnd).

* Product keywords should be a single input with unique keywords list (use
CreatableSelect from react-select).

* On submit the form should console.log a single object with all form values
that could be potentially sent to backend.

Whole form should be pretty :) use react-bootstrap.

*Save as .zip*
